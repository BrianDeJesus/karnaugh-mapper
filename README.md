# Karnaugh map solver

This program simplifies boolean expressions using the k-map method.




* Simplifies Boolean expressions for up to four variables.

* Assume the variables on the map are in alphabetical order starting with the first and then the columns

  * Example: A four variable map would use AB for the rows and CD for the columns

* Run the following file with Python 3 like this:

```
python3 karnaughmapsolver.py
