# Karnaugh map solver

This program simplifies boolean expressions using the k-map method.


* The result will be in sop (sum of products) form

* Simplifies Boolean expressions for up to four variables

* Assume the variables on the map are in alphabetical order starting with the rows first, and then the columns

  * Example: A four variable map would use AB for the rows and CD for the columns

* Run the following file with Python 3 like this:

```
$ python3 karnaughmapsolver.py
```
